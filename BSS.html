        <div class="note-body">
            <p>Services are defined by five core characteristics that distinguish them from physical goods and shape how they are marketed and consumed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intangibility:</strong> Services are experiences that cannot be seen or touched before purchase, creating uncertainty. Marketers use tangible cues like a professional environment to signal quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Inseparability:</strong> Services are often produced and consumed simultaneously, making the service provider a critical part of the service itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Variability (Heterogeneity):</strong> The quality of a service can vary greatly depending on who provides it and when. Firms use standardization and training to manage this inconsistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Perishability:</strong> Services cannot be stored for later use. An unsold airline seat or empty hotel room represents lost revenue that can never be recovered.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Ownership:</strong> Customers purchase the right to a service or experience, not ownership of a physical object. Marketing focuses on the benefits and value created.</li>

        <h2 class="note-title">Unit 1: Classification/Types of Service</h2>
        <div class="note-body">
            <p>Services can be categorized using several frameworks to better inform a firm's marketing and operational strategy.</p>
            <h3>Based on the Nature of the Service Act</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>People Processing:</strong> Tangible actions on a person's body (e.g., healthcare, haircuts).</li>
                <li><strong>Possession Processing:</strong> Tangible actions on a physical possession (e.g., car repair, laundry).</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Stimulus Processing:</strong> Intangible actions on a person's mind (e.g., education, entertainment).</li>
                <li><strong>Information Processing:</strong> Intangible actions on a person's intangible assets (e.g., banking, legal services).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Based on Delivery Mode</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>People-Based:</strong> Service quality depends on the provider's skill (e.g., consultants, plumbers).</li>
                <li><strong>Equipment-Based:</strong> Service is delivered primarily by technology (e.g., ATMs, vending machines).</li>
            </ul>
             <h3>Based on Customer Involvement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Involvement:</strong> Requires active customer collaboration (e.g., personal training).</li>
                <li><strong>Low-Involvement:</strong> Requires minimal customer interaction (e.g., self-service kiosks).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Based on Business Orientation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profit-Oriented:</strong> The main objective is financial gain (e.g., private hospitals, airlines).</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Profit-Oriented:</strong> The primary goal is social welfare (e.g., public libraries, charities).</li>

        <div class="note-body">
            <p>Modern customers expect a sophisticated, holistic experience that goes beyond basic service. Businesses must meet these heightened expectations to remain competitive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Connected and Consistent Journeys:</strong> Customers expect a seamless experience across all channels (online, in-store, mobile) and dislike repeating information.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Personalization:</strong> Customers want to be treated as unique individuals and expect companies to use their data to provide tailored recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed, Efficiency, and Convenience:</strong> Fast response times, quick issue resolution, and multiple support options (omnichannel) are critical.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust, Transparency, and Data Protection:</strong> Customers are protective of their personal data and expect companies to be transparent about its use.</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy and Being Heard:</strong> Customers need to feel that their concerns are understood and valued. An empathetic approach can turn a negative situation into a positive one.</li>
                <li><strong>Proactive Service:</strong> Leading companies anticipate potential issues and offer solutions before the customer is even aware of a problem.</li>

        <div class="note-body">
            <p>Consumer expectations are shaped by a mix of personal history, company communications, and external influences.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Past Experience:</strong> A customer's previous interactions with the same brand or other best-in-class companies set the standard.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing and Communication:</strong> A company's explicit promises (advertising) and implicit cues (high pricing suggesting high quality) directly shape expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Word-of-Mouth and Social Proof:</strong> Recommendations from friends, family, online reviews, and social media are highly influential.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Needs and Situational Factors:</strong> A customer's unique needs and temporary circumstances can intensify expectations (e.g., a person in a hurry expects speed).</li>
                <li><strong>Perceived Service Alternatives:</strong> If a customer is aware of many high-quality alternatives, their expectations for any single provider will be higher.</li>

                <li><strong>Phase 3: Ideate:</strong> Based on the research, this creative phase involves brainstorming a wide range of potential solutions through collaborative workshops.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 4: Prototype:</strong> The most promising ideas are turned into low-fidelity, testable versions (e.g., storyboards, role-playing) to learn quickly from real users before full-scale development.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation and Iteration:</strong> After a successful prototype, the service is launched. The cycle is iterative, meaning feedback is continuously gathered to refine and improve the service over time.</li>
